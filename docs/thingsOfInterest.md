Terraform gets the exclude target even though it shouldn't
Error message stemming from eval_providers.go, leads to node_resource_destroy.go in managedResourceExecute

ignore below
There is an init provider in node_provider that is probably the issue

Stopped here b/c import is an actual command.
Alternatively one goes into tranform_import_state.go, which actually contains target, so I added a new field to the struct and reused the same logic, went to find where the struct was used, in graph_builder_import, then added a new field to the struct, found where that was used, in context_import.go, that contained ImportOps(struct) + ImportTarget(struct). Stopped here b/c import is an actual command.
